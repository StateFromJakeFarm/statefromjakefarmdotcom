    <p style="font-size: 20px">Hello, my name is Jake Hansen!  I’m a recent university graduate with deep passion for programming, machine learning, and linguistics.  My spare time is often spent building things with Python and C++, as well as torturing myself on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.hackerrank.com/jhansen44">HackerRank.</a></p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">My time in college exposed me to a number of awesome, tech-centered communities, each of which gave me invaluable experience and colleagues.  I served as president of my school’s Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) chapter for two years and also worked as a year-round software development intern for the Automation team at Aruba Networks.
                               See my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="{% static "resume.pdf" %}">resume</a> for a more thorough overview of my experience.</p>
